          <h2>What is Design Fiction?</h2>

          <aside class="notes">All designers “grapple with the unknowability of the future.” (Reeves, 2016.) A designer gets charged with the task of improving something. That improved something doesn’t exist yet, and the designer can only guess about what kind of future their work will find itself in.   Design fiction is an emerging, slippery, open-ended kind of design practice. Some people contextualize design fiction as a research method; for them, it is storytelling about the near future that works as a type of anticipatory ethnography. (Lindley, 2014.) Others take a more critical, speculative approach. To them, design can “speculate about future possibilities” or be a “catalyst for change.” Rather than accepting the momentum of technological change as a given, where it might seem like a designer’s job is to implement the status quo, critical approaches let designers ask questions or participate in conversations about what kind of future is being created.

          <aside class="notes">We have been inspired by both the storytelling and critical aspects of design fiction to create activities and materials for two different workshops to try to bring aspects of design into libraries.   For each, we created games that allowed participants to play games to explore new ideas. Like Huizinga’s magic circle, we tried to create a space that would allow them “to behave differently” (Ham, 2016). It also allowed us to experiment with the type of material we presented. Rather than telling participants, “this works”, the critical, experimental aspects of approaches like design fiction inspired us to ask, “could this work”, or “what parts of this might work?”</aside>

            <br/>Isabel Gonzalez-Smith, John Jung, Leo Lo<br/>
            <em>I2C2: Innovation, Inspiration and Creativity Conference. Manchester, UK, March 6-7, 2014</em></p>
        </span>
        <aside class="notes">The Library Persuasion Game<br/>The I2C2 Conference was about “Innovation, Inspiration and Creativity” in libraries. I put together workshop for this conference with Isabel Gonzales-Smith and Leo Lo. We realized that at a conference like this it would be easy for participants to come back excited and ready to put ideas into practice, only to be discouraged when they tried to convince others back at their library to try something new. To help librarians get over that hurdle we developed a workshop to introduce them to Robert Cialdini's model of the persuasion process. We created a game to play at the workshop that would let participants practice “selling” their ideas to others. Here’s how to play: the game has two players. One player is “the boss”. The boss gets a pack of idea cards. Each card contains an idea for an innovative library service. Some of the services are realistic, like “library offers computers for video editing.” Others are silly or crazy, like “wild animal rehabilitation” or “chainsaw carving”. The boss chooses an idea card and says, “I’ve heard some office chatter about a new idea...is this...chainsaw carving in the library? Can you tell me a little more about this?” The second player is “the persuasive librarian.” This player gets a set of six cards, one for each of Robert Cialdini’s principles of influence. This player’s job is to improvise a persuasive argument for the idea—in this case, chainsaw carving.</aside>

        </span>
        <aside class="notes">The persuasive librarian might hold up the “Authority” card and say something like “So, my old college friend, Paul Bunyonsen, is a pretty well-respected wood carver. He’s putting a show together at that fancy new gallery up in Sheyboygan. We started talking, and it seems like his work could be a good fit for our library.” Holding up the “Commitment and Consistency” card, the persuasive librarian continues. “Anyway, the new strategic plan is for us to put together innovative programs that appeal to the people in our rustic, wooded community. And so I thought, what better way to do that than with chainsaws?”The fictional world that we set up, with a librarian, a boss, a bunch of pre-made ideas, and Dr. Cialdini’s model of persuasion, gave participants the chance to practice a new skill. But we also observed that people were looking at the material critically—many people wanted to bring a deck of cards home so they could play with their bosses and coworkers. They didn’t want to use the material to exert influence over them; they wanted to use the material to spark conversations with them. </aside>

            <p>"From User Testing to Prototypes: Making Observations Tangible,"<br/><em>Designing for Digital, Austin, TX. April 6, 2016.</em></p>
        </span>
        <aside class="notes">Earlier this year, we developed a brainstorming workshop for librarians. We presented this work in two different places- first at the Designing For Digital 2016 conference, and next at the Chicago Library UX Meetup Group. We observed that it was really common in meetings to hear someone say, “Lets brainstorm.” However, the resulting brainstorming sessions tended to produce a small number of ideas, and not a large number. Because brainstorming sessions tend to generate a small percentage of high quality ideas, it’s important that participants are able to generate lots of ideas. In order to give librarians a chance to practice brainstorming, we created a fictional grocery store we called Flipman Foods. During the course of a four-hour workshop participants receive a series of letters from Walt Flipman, the CEO of Flipman Foods, which challenge them to brainstorm ideas using different techniques. On one hand, the letters are ways to introduce participants to different methods that can help them generate ideas. We introduce them to using background research as a way to inform the brainstorming process, and we show them how to develop short skits to communicate clearly about the ideas they come up with.</aside>

            <p>Sample letter from "Brainstorming and Prototyping Workshop."</p>
        </span>
        <aside class="notes">At the same time, the character of Walt Flipman is one element of the workshop lets us guide the kind of ideas that participants will generate. Participants get to know who Walt is, and they try to make ideas that Walt would like. Flipman Foods is a high-end grocery story. At the beginning of the workshop, when we asked participants about the last time they walked out of the grocery story with something they didn’t expect to buy, they gave us lots of examples of techniques they used to be sure they ONLY bought what they needed when they went shopping. But by the end of the workshop, they were coming up with ideas that would help Flipman Foods “encourage healthy eating and be environmentally responsible”, while still remaining “wildly profitable.” By playing at brainstorming for a grocery store, participants get the chance to practice some new skills. In this case the short skits that participants developed were a way to quickly experiment with possible futures. Here the fictional world lets them borrow ideas from another industry. Then, when the game ends, we can ask them to be critical again. We can ask, “Is there anything here that we could incorporate into the world of libraries<br/>
        After developing these playful experiences for workshops, we wanted to find a way to put what we were doing into context so we can figure out ways to push it further. Design Fiction is an approach that we find very inspiring, because of its storytelling and critical qualities. Next we’ll talk about where the term “Design Fiction” came from, and we’ll give a few examples of some design fiction in the wild. If design fiction is something in you’re interested in and you’d like to experiment with, we’re including citations in these slides so you can follow our references and get up to speed quickly.</aside>

          <aside class="notes">These workshops all dealt with the act of play, but within the circle of probably and plausible futures. "Probably" being things "likely to happen" and "plausible" being things that could happen. As you get further into the future, things become more open and flexible. So what if we expanded it to include the possible and pushed more into the future? The what-ifs, like warp speed on Star Trek or time travel on Doctor Who. This imagining is sometimes called speculative design, which is another word for design fiction.</aside>

          <p>“We believe that by speculating more, at all levels of society, and exploring alternative scenarios, reality will become more malleable and, although the future cannot be predicted, we can help set in place today factors that will increase the probability of more desirable futures happening.”<br/><br/>

          <aside class="notes">But why speculate? Like play, it opens up our realms of possibilities and helps us explore in an undefined space. We are free to come up we solutions or even further problems, that we would have never considered if we kept our thoughts in the here and now.

          <aside class="notes">So who defines what is desireable? As humans, we want to create the best scenerio for ourselves. This brings in the aspect of preferrable futures, which is what we "want to" happen. This type of future is more emotional than cognitive, stemming from value judgements. Because values differ between people, this class of futures can vary. With this, we step into the concept of utopian and dystopian futures. Both are important to traverse, but when exploring possible futures, we need to try to stay cognitive and not let our emotions dictate possible outcomes.</aside>

          <aside class="notes">In general, people try to shy away from possible negative futures, because one always wants to depict a future as they prefer to see themselves in. But the thing is, there are very good reasons to consider the dystopian aspect when working with design fiction. While a positive future shows the strengths of your solutions, a negative outcome will help you foresee the flaws. And contemporary designs have borrowed from past artists to create the Design Fiction project of today and tomorrow.</aside>

          <img class="stretch" style="border:0; box-shadow: none;" src="images/books.png"/>
          <aside class="notes">Bruce Sterling has been credited with inventing the term “design fiction” in this 2005 book. The book is mainly about the changing landscape of design, and how designed things have increasingly digital components. He makes the point that these changes will probably fall somewhere along a spectrum between utopian and dystopian. The book presents a context for thinking about why design fiction is useful. In a world where technological changes seem to be increasingly rapid and disruptive, it makes sense to think critically about technology and to work to find new ways to explore and think about near future possibilities. His blog, Beyond the Beyond, includes links to interesting design fiction projects, upcoming exhibitions, and more. Design Fiction: A short essay on design, science, fact and fiction Julian Bleecker begins this essay by noting how many fields seem to have design attached to them. There is service design, experience design, research design or even finance design. On one hand, this has the potential to “blanch” the word design of it’s meaning over time. But on the other hand, it also tries to indicate, “we haven’t entirely worked through what it means to do finance and design simultaneously. We’ll work it out, but we know this—we’re trying to do something different, and clever, and creative and thoughtful.” (Bleecker 2009.)</aside>

          <p>"One is lost in a new world of a thousand possibilities...which will carry one forward into a completely unknown territory"</p>
          <small><em>Pierced Forms</em> (1959)<br/>Barbara Hepworth</small>
          <aside class="notes">Design Fiction has been used by artists for years from the small task of sketching to the final work of a performance piece. Yet, we are just beginning to catch on to what artists have been doing for decades. For example, the sculpter Barbara Hepworth used sketching and drawing as an exploratory medium; an art she felt was an "exciting adventure." She saw drawing as freeing since it didn't have the same rules as the solid materials she carved from. Hepworth would have no goal in mind but to put down lines, one after another. She decribed the act of drawing as being "lost in a new world of a thousand possibilities because the next line in association with the first will have a compulsion about it which will carry one forward into a completely unknown territory." The thing is, a sketch artist would most likely have the same feeling of freedom when it came to sculpture because it is not their chosen medium. There are no rules set for them because it is OK to break them. This is what Design Fiction does for us. It allows us to work outside of our everyday medium, present reality, and gives us the freedom to embark on an "exciting adventure" of possibilities.</aside>

          <aside class="notes">There are a multitude of ways to explore the range of possibile futures with meaningful results. In 1972 the German artist Joseph Beuys turned education and discussion into art with his 'Bureau for Direct Democracy' performance piece. For 100 days Beuys held "office hours" and discussed political, artistic, and social issues with visitors. His goal was to come to a solution that would realize "true democracy." He didn't pre-define what "true democracy" was for the participants, but allowed them to explore what that meant to them. This allowed participants and Beuys to explore all possible solutions, both negative and positive. The openness of these performance-lectures were not bound by practiced or pre-determined events, but were intended to organically prompt further discussions by the audience during and after the performance. Beuys forced passive gallery vistors to take an active role in their possible futures.</aside>

The video they made shows how a smark fork, smart cane, and smart bed all fail when put against the habits of an elderly man who is set in his ways. This video is meant not to create solutions, but much like Beuys' project, to stimulate conversation. With that in mind, we are going to infuse some Beuysian and __ theory into this presentation and discuss the implecations this video exposes after we watch it.

How goal reminders, achievement reports, and sharing with friends and family can become frustrating.

          <img class="stretch" style="border:0; box-shadow: none;" src="images/collab.jpg"/>
          <aside class="notes">In “The Public Place of Central Libraries”, Gloria Leckie and Jeffrey Hopkins speculate about people in a knowledge-based economy. “People must continually educate themselves, upgrade their skills, and reorient themselves to new realities.” At the same time people are using libraries to remain relevant economically, they’re using libraries to “create culture.” Leckie and Hopkins describe a wide variety of creative projects they found people working on that “could not be characterized as merely recreational.” Patrons were using the library to inform things like theater set design, research for a film, or a photography exhibition. “Research suggests that the search for relevant information and its subsequent use in productive activity may be an integral characteristic of the construction of contemporary public culture in the emergent twenty-first century.” (Leckie, 2002) If this is true, then design fiction might have some potential for both practical and cultural purposes, because in each type of use, people are playing with new realities. We hope you’ll look at design fiction from a critical perspective. Could you use this? Could you use a part of this?</aside>
