          <aside class="notes">Jej: All designers “grapple with the unknowability of the future.” (Reeves, 2016.) A designer gets charged with the task of improving something. That improved something doesn’t exist yet, and the designer can only guess about what kind of future their work will find itself in.   Design fiction is an emerging, slippery, open-ended kind of design practice. Some people contextualize design fiction as a research method; for them, it is storytelling about the near future that works as a type of anticipatory ethnography. (Lindley, 2014.) Others take a more critical, speculative approach. To them, design can “speculate about future possibilities” or be a “catalyst for change.” Rather than accepting the momentum of technological change as a given, where it might seem like a designer’s job is to implement the status quo, critical approaches let designers ask questions or participate in conversations about what kind of future is being created.

          <aside class="notes"><p>Jej: Although they don’t sound like science fiction, we have been inspired by both the storytelling and critical aspects of design fiction to create activities and materials for two different workshops to try to bring aspects of design into libraries.</p>
          <p>For each, we created games that allowed participants to play games to explore new ideas. Like Huizinga’s magic circle, we tried to create a space that would allow them “to behave differently” (Ham, 2016). It also allowed us to experiment with the type of material we presented. Rather than telling participants, “this works”, the critical, experimental aspects of approaches like design fiction inspired us to ask, “could this work”, or “what parts of this might work?” It freed us up to experiment.</p></aside>

          <aside class="notes">KZ: UX, UI, and Design Fiction all have an element of play. As we grow older, we are told that play has no purpose or even that it is a waste of time. But the problem-solving we go through while at play turn into flexibility and concepts in our work and the real word. Dr. Stuart Brown, a pioneer in research on play, observed that the action of play puts you in an altered state that allows you to explore possibilities you would not otherwise discover. The act of play literally opens up your mind to a different level of comprehenstion. Brown's research has found that the individuals participating in group play attune to each other and reach the same altered state of exploration together. This group play concept is perfect to tap into for workshops, and that is just what we did. We started with a game designed to help librarians be more persuasive.</aside>

            <p>"Bringing it Home: Tools to Bridge the Gap Between Inspiration and Real Action,"
            <br/>Isabel Gonzalez-Smith, John Jung, Leo Lo<br/>
            <em>I2C2: Innovation, Inspiration and Creativity Conference. Manchester, UK, March 6-7, 2014</em></p>
        </span>
        <aside class="notes"><p>Jej: The I2C2 Conference was about “Innovation, Inspiration and Creativity” in libraries. I put together workshop for this conference with Isabel Gonzales-Smith and Leo Lo. We realized that at a conference like this it would be easy for participants to come back excited and ready to put ideas into practice, only to be discouraged when they tried to convince others back at their library to try something new. To help librarians get over that hurdle we developed a workshop to introduce them to Robert Cialdini's model of the persuasion process. We created a game to play at the workshop that would let participants practice “selling” their ideas to others.</p>
        <p>Here’s how to play: the game has two players. One player is “the boss”. The boss gets a pack of idea cards. Each card contains an idea for an innovative library service. Some of the services are realistic, like “library offers computers for video editing.” Others are silly or crazy, like “wild animal rehabilitation” or “chainsaw carving”.</p>
        <p>The boss chooses an idea card and says, “I’ve heard some office chatter about a new idea...is this...chainsaw carving in the library? Can you tell me a little more about this?”</p></aside>

        <aside class="notes"><p>Jej: The second player is “the persuasive librarian.” This player gets a set of six cards, one for each of Robert Cialdini’s principles of influence. This player’s job is to improvise a persuasive argument for the idea—in this case, chainsaw carving. The persuasive librarian might hold up the “Authority” card and say something like “So, my old college friend, Paul Bunyonsen, is a pretty well-respected wood carver. He’s putting a show together at that fancy new gallery up in Sheyboygan. We started talking, and it seems like his work could be a good fit for our library.” Holding up the “Commitment and Consistency” card, the persuasive librarian continues. “Anyway, the new strategic plan is for us to put together innovative programs that appeal to the people in our rustic, wooded community. And so I thought, what better way to do that than with chainsaws?”</p>
        <p>The fictional world that we set up, with a librarian, a boss, a bunch of pre-made ideas, and Dr. Cialdini’s model of persuasion, gave participants the chance to practice a new skill. But we also observed that people were looking at the material critically—many people wanted to bring a deck of cards home so they could play with their bosses and coworkers. They didn’t want to use the material to exert influence over them; they wanted to use the material to spark conversations with them.</p></aside>

          <img class="stretch" style="border:0;" src="images/brainstorming.jpg"/>
          <span style="font-size:0.8em;">
            <p>"Brainstorming and Prototyping Workshop,"<br/><em>Library UX Chicago, Chicago, IL. August 19, 2016.</em></p>
            <p>"From User Testing to Prototypes: Making Observations Tangible,"<br/><em>Designing for Digital, Austin, TX. April 6, 2016.</em></p>
        </span>
        <aside class="notes"><p>Jej: Earlier this year, we developed a brainstorming workshop for librarians. We presented this work in two different places- first at the Designing For Digital 2016 conference, and next at the Chicago Library UX Meetup Group.</p>
        <p>We observed that it was really common in meetings to hear someone say, “Lets brainstorm.” However, the resulting brainstorming sessions tended to produce a small number of ideas, and not a large number. Because brainstorming sessions tend to generate a small percentage of high quality ideas, it’s important that participants are able to generate lots of ideas.</p>
        <p>In order to give librarians a chance to practice brainstorming, we created a fictional grocery store we called Flipman Foods. During the course of a four-hour workshop participants receive a series of letters from Walt Flipman, the CEO of Flipman Foods, which challenge them to brainstorm ideas using different techniques.</p>
        <p>On one hand, the letters are ways to introduce participants to different methods that can help them generate ideas. We introduce them to using background research as a way to inform the brainstorming process, and we show them how to develop short skits to communicate clearly about the ideas they come up with.</p></aside>

          <span style="font-size:0.8em;"><small>Sample letter from "Brainstorming and Prototyping Workshop."</small></span>
        <aside class="notes"><p>Jej: At the same time, the character of Walt Flipman is one element of the workshop lets us guide the kind of ideas that participants will generate. Participants get to know who Walt is, and they try to make ideas that Walt would like. Flipman Foods is a high-end grocery story. At the beginning of the workshop, when we asked participants about the last time they walked out of the grocery story with something they didn’t expect to buy, they gave us lots of examples of techniques they used to be sure they ONLY bought what they needed when they went shopping. But by the end of the workshop, they were coming up with ideas that would help Flipman Foods “encourage healthy eating and be environmentally responsible”, while still remaining “wildly profitable.”</p>
        <p>By playing at brainstorming for a grocery store, participants get the chance to practice some new skills. In this case the short skits that participants developed were a way to quickly experiment with possible futures. Here the fictional world lets them borrow ideas from another industry.</p>
        <p>Then, when the game ends, we can ask them to be critical again. We can ask, “Is there anything here that we could incorporate into the world of libraries?”</p></aside>

          <img class="stretch" style="border:0; box-shadow: none;" src="images/nature-laptop.jpg"/>
          <aside class="notes"><p>Jej: When we design what’s going to happen in one of our workshops, we’re thinking about how to make an experience that is memorable, and that allows for exploration. Thinking of the Library Persuasion Game and the Flipman Foods brainstorming game, in each workshop we created a space outside of people’s everyday experience, where special rules applied. Then we used people’s inherent love of play to let them try something new. </p>
          <p>After developing these playful experiences for workshops, we wanted to find a way to put what we were doing into context so we can find ways to push it further. Design Fiction is an approach that we find very inspiring, because of its storytelling and critical qualities.</p>
          <p>We’ll talk about where the term “Design Fiction” came from, and we’ll give a few examples of some design fiction in the wild. If design fiction is something in you’re interested in and you’d like to experiment with, we’re including citations in these slides so you can follow our references and get up to speed quickly.</p></aside>

          <small style="font-size:0.5em;">Adapted from Henchey, N. (1978) Making Sense of Futures Studies. ‘Alternatives.’ 7 p24–29.</small>
          <aside class="notes"><p>KZ: These workshops all dealt with the act of play within the very near future. We had the participants stay in a narrow and short path of probably and plausible futures. "Probably" being things "likely to happen" and "plausible" being things that could happen.</p>
          <p>As you get further into the future, things become super fuzzy. When you expand and open it up to the possible, concepts get more mysterious. This wider fuzzier future is the land of what-ifs, like warp speed on Star Trek or time travel on Doctor Who. This imagining is sometimes called speculative design, which is another word for design fiction. Design fiction makes you embrace the mystery. Sit in the fuzziness. Like play, speculation opens up our realms of possibility and helps us explore an undefined space.</p></aside>

          <aside class="notes">In general, people try to shy away from possible negative futures, because one always wants to depict a future as they prefer to see themselves in. But the thing is, there are very good reasons to consider the dystopian aspect when working with design fiction. While a positive future shows the strengths of your solutions, a negative outcome will help you foresee the flaws. And contemporary designers have borrowed from past artists to create the Design Fiction projects of today and tomorrow.</aside>

           <h2>Design Fiction</h2>
          <img class="stretch" style="border:0; box-shadow: none;" src="images/books.png"/>
          <aside class="notes"><p>Jej: Bruce Sterling is an author who wrote the short story anthology Mirrorshades. It is a defining collection of short cyberpunk science fiction stories. Vinay Gupta said that in order to understand the “Silicon Valley” mindset that is behind a lot of new, disruptive technology like Uber, you need to read cyberpunk fiction. This is because the ideas in that genre of fiction are like myths that drive a certain mindset of technological innovation that is happening in the world right now. He said that Bruce Sterling’s work is an ideal starting point. (Fiber, 2016.)</p>
          <p>Bruce Sterling is also credited with inventing the term “design fiction” in this 2005 non-fiction book. “Shaping Things” is about the changing landscape of design, and how designed things have increasingly digital components.</p>
          <p>In the introduction he says that “the ideal readers for this book are those ambitious young souls (of any age) who want to constructively intervene in the process of technosocial transformation...it’s for designers and thinkers, engineers and scientists, entrepreneurs and financiers, and anyone else who might care to understand why things were once as they were, why things are as they are, and what things seem to be becoming.”</p>
          <p>According to Sterling, this is important. First, because new forms of design and manufacturing are appearing, and the new forms have no historical precedents. Second, we need to move beyond current production methods, because they’re unsustainable. They “wreck the climate, poison the populace and forment resource wars.”</p>
          <p>Maybe because Bruce Sterling is a science fiction author, it is natural for him to use fiction as a way to think through real world issues like the changing landscape of technology. In any case, the book presents a context for thinking about why design fiction might be useful. In a world where technological changes seem to be increasingly rapid and disruptive, it makes sense to think critically about technology and to work to find new ways to explore and think about near future possibilities.</p>
          <p>His blog, Beyond the Beyond, includes links to interesting design fiction projects, upcoming exhibitions, and more.</p>
          <p>Design Fiction: A short essay on design, science, fact and fiction</p>
          <p>Julian Bleecker picked up the ball of design fiction and ran with it, in this 2009 essay. He begins by noting how many fields seem to have the word “design” attached to them. There is service design, experience design, research design or even finance design. On one hand, this has the potential to “blanch” the word design of it’s meaning over time. But on the other hand, it also tries to indicate, “we haven’t entirely worked through what it means to do finance and design simultaneously. We’ll work it out, but we know this—we’re trying to do something different, and clever, and creative and thoughtful.” (Bleecker 2009.)</p>
          <p>His approach is very much rooted in an appreciation of science fiction, and its ability to produce thought-provoking visions of what the future might be like. He describes the obsessive research that went into the making of the film 2001, from the visualizations on different control panels, to the materials that might be used to make space suits, to the companies and brands that might exist in the future.</p>
          <p>The relationship between science fact and science fiction is really important to Bleecker. For him, design fiction is all about playing in the space between the two practices.</p></aside>

          <p>"One is lost in a new world of a thousand possibilities...which will carry one forward into a completely unknown territory"</p>
          <small><em>Pierced Forms</em> (1959)<br/>Barbara Hepworth</small>
          <aside class="notes"><p>KZ: Design Fiction has been used by artists for years from the small task of sketching to the final work of a performance piece. Yet, we are just beginning to catch on to what artists have been doing for decades. For example, the sculptor Barbara Hepworth used sketching and drawing as an exploratory medium; an art she felt was an "exciting adventure." She saw drawing as freeing since it didn't have the same rules as the solid materials she carved from. Hepworth would have no goal in mind but to put down lines, one after another. She described the act of drawing as being "lost in a new world of a thousand possibilities because the next line in association with the first will have a compulsion about it which will carry one forward into a completely unknown territory."</p>
          <p>The thing is, a sketch artist would most likely have the same feeling of freedom when it came to sculpture because it is not their chosen medium. There are no rules set for them because it is OK to break them. This is what Design Fiction does for us. It allows us to work outside of our everyday medium, present reality, and gives us the freedom to embark on an "exciting adventure" of possibilities.</p></aside>

          <aside class="notes"><p>KZ: There are a multitude of ways to explore the range of possible futures with meaningful results. In 1972 the German artist Joseph Beuys turned education and discussion into art with his 'Bureau for Direct Democracy' performance piece. For 100 days Beuys held "office hours" and discussed political, artistic, and social issues with visitors. His goal was to come to a solution that would realize "true democracy." He didn't pre-define what "true democracy" was for the participants, but allowed them to explore what that meant to them. This allowed participants and Beuys to explore all possible solutions, both negative and positive. The openness of these performance-lectures were not bound by practiced or pre-determined events, but were intended to organically prompt further discussions by the audience during and after the performance. Beuys forced passive gallery visitors to take an active role in their possible futures.</p>
          <p>The way Beuys encouraged participants to play with a broad goal is similar to how designers think about playfulness. This brings us something people call “ludic design.”</p></aside>

          <h2>Homo Ludens</h2>
          <img class="stretch" style="border:0; box-shadow: none;" src="images/Baseball.png"/>
          <aside class="notes"><p>Jej: Right now the Chicago Cubs are playing the Cleveland Indians in the World Series. If I wear a Cubs hat in here, Indians fans might boo.</p>
          <p>What are some of the qualities of a baseball game? It takes place in a special place—on a baseball field. You can go to a stadium to see a professional game if you want, but anyone who has ever played baseball could also make a field anywhere there is enough space. If you taught a child how to play baseball you would probably do it in a park or a backyard. You might say things like “that tree is going to be first base.”</p>
          <p>Baseball has special costumes. Teams get their own special clothes, and umpires have a special way to dress. You see baseball hats all the time, even when people aren’t playing.</p>
          <p>There are rules to follow. In order to play, all of the participants “follow the rules.” If you were teaching a really small child how to play baseball, they might start to improvise, and invent their own game. You might have to teach them about what it means to follow the rules. When you follow the rules in baseball, it’s more fun! If a teenager or an adult breaks the rules while playing, people will call it cheating. They might lose friends. If a professional player gets caught cheating, they could get fined thousands of dollars.</p>
          <p>When it comes to baseball, players aren’t the only ones playing—being a fan is also a kind of play. There is lots to do when you’re a fan. You talk to strangers about what happened at the last game. You learn about legends or stories associated with you team. In Chicago, some fans are famous. It’s common to see Ronnie “Woo Woo” Wickers out and about, wearing his Cubs uniform, even when the team isn’t in town. I don’t know anything about the culture of Cleveland Indians fans, because I’m not part of that group. But I bet that people who follow that team have all kinds of stories too.</p>
          <p>From the “outside”, being a baseball fan might not make any sense. You might be “into” something else that has its own culture. When people say they’re “into” something, what does it mean?</p>
          <p>For a lot of these things, there is a certain designated place and time where people get together to do some kind of activity. There might be special costumes, rules, or traditions. When Johan Huizinga wrote about what it means to play, he called these qualities “the magic circle”. Whether it’s for a baseball game or something else, whether it is physically marked off or just agreed upon, inside that space, the participants all agree that special rules apply. What happens then and there is different from ordinary life. Inside the circle of the game “the laws and customs of ordinary life no longer count.”</p></aside>

          <aside class="notes">KZ: As John’s baseball example points out, the key to using group play to your advantage is to have structure. I know this sounds like two completely opposed thoughts, but one can have structured play that creates unexpected and original thoughts. You can see this in the works of Allan Kaprow, who became famous in the 1960s for his "happenings." His main goal with happenings, which is performance art that involves normally passive viewers as participants, was to eliminate the audience. The audience was to open up to the art and free themselves in ways they weren't allowed to do in art before.</aside>

          <aside class="notes"><p>KZ: This is a solid point–you need your participants to be in on the fun, not the butt of the joke. For example, Kaprow's 1963 happening 'Fluids' involved participants creating a simple structure out of ice blocks. You will have more enthusiastic participants if you preface the happening invitation with something like "be ready to get wet and to carry 20 pounds for several hours." Could you imagine showing up to this event without any warning and just be handed a brick of ice?</p>
          <p>While individual play can blossom without structure, unstructured group play can produce meager or negative results. Design Fiction helps gives us this framework. Beuys chose a specific topic, location, and time frame for his piece. Contemporary designers do the same with their explorations, framing the type of technology within a specific future outcome. Within this structured play, one sits comfortably in the fuzzy mystery of it all.</p></aside>

          <h1>design &ne; task performance</h1>
          <aside class="notes"><p>Jej: Bill Gaver is Professor of Design at the University of London. He was very much inspired by the ideas in the book Homo Ludens, and talked a lot about “ludic design”. In a 2007 interview, he talked about what he meant by that term.</p>
          <p>“There are a huge number of activities that we pursue in everyday life that are not about achieving some external goal but are done merely for the sake of enjoyment and pleasure...by play here I don’t mean game play...I mean something much more fluid and self-motivated...examples of play are things like...fooling around with friends and taking on imaginary roles when you’re having a chat with them...or taking a new walk on the way home from work just to see where you get.” He continues, “it’s potentially quite culturally important to recognize and appreciate these forms of activities because more and more technology and design in general is conceived of in terms of promoting task performance and that means that it conveys a view that all our lives are about doing work, basically.” (Gaffney, 2007.)</p></aside>

          <small>The Pillow, by Tony Dunne</small>
          <aside class="notes"><p>Jej: In the essay “Designing for Homo Ludens, Still”, he asks, “How can we invent and develop systems that legitimize wonder, even encourage it? How do we encourage people to meander, rather than to accomplish tasks with speed?” (Gaver, 2002.) He provides examples of designed objects that inspire reflection instead of task completion. The Pillow, is a pillow that glows with color patterns produced by an LCD screen. It takes electromagnetic radiation, like what is produced by radio stations, as input, but instead of rendering the input sharply it renders it in an imprecise way. It’s meant to point out how much wireless communication there really is in our environment, and it’s meant to get the people who live with this object to reflect on that. (Gaver, 2002.)</p></aside>

          <small>The Drift Table, by Tony Dunne</small>
          <aside class="notes"><p>Jej: The Drift Table is another example. This is a small coffee table with a circular view port on top which shows aerial photography of the British countryside. It is loaded with almost a terabyte of data, but it doesn’t include a straightforward interface to “go somewhere”. Instead the people who own the table get to wander.</p>
          <p>This isn’t about transmitting information and certain kinds of beliefs to our participants. These projects want to see how people respond to the material, even if that means they reject it. MIT Labs has been using this ludic approach to open up the conversation in a really nice way. </p></aside>

          <aside class="notes"><p>Jej: Fashion brand Kenzo teamed up with Carrie Brownstein (guitarist for the band Sleater-Kinney and star of the comedy series Portlandia) for this short film about Internet fandom. In an interview on Kenzo’s website, Brownstein said the movie is about “the idea that you can kind of insert yourself into the narrative of someone’s life, and into your idol’s life, through visuals, through songs, etc.it became about exploring ideas of fantasy and projection, but taking a more absurdist view of that, when fantasy comes slamming into reality.” (Brownstein, 2016.)</p>

          <aside class="notes">KZ: In a similar thread as Brownstein's video, Superflux Lab explored how our lives are shaped by a smart environment. The video they made shows how a smart fork, smart cane, and smart bed all fail when put against the habits of an elderly man who is set in his ways. This video is meant not to create solutions, but much like Beuys' project, to stimulate conversation. With that in mind, we are going to infuse some Beuysian theory into this presentation and discuss the implications this video exposes after we watch it. So let's take a look at how Superlux Labs explored the possible failures of a "one size fits all" solution to smart objects for the elderly.</aside>

          <aside class="notes">KZ: This video explores how smart items, which are created to make our lives better, can actually have the opposite effect. Superflux Lab shows how the notifications can disrupt healthy daily habits, like reading, that have been long engrained. How goal reminders, achievement reports, and sharing with friends and family can become frustrating. While depressing, this makes you think about how to create smart items and apps that will actually mesh with a person's lifestyle while altering their behaviors.</aside>

          <h2>Conclusion: Why Libraries?</h2>
          <img class="stretch" style="border:0; box-shadow: none;" src="images/collab.jpg"/>
          <aside class="notes"><p>Jej: When it comes to this kind of approach, we are feeling our way. We experiment, and see what works and what doesn’t. We look at different precedents to find a way to put what works into context so we can build on it.</p>
          <p>This brings us to libraries, and why to us, this kind of thinking really makes sense in libraries. It has to do with the idea that was popular a few years back, of “the library as a third place.”</p>
          <p>In “The Public Place of Central Libraries”, Gloria Leckie and Jeffrey Hopkins speculate about people in a knowledge-based economy. “People must continually educate themselves, upgrade their skills, and reorient themselves to new realities.” At the same time people are using libraries to remain relevant economically, they’re using libraries to “create culture.” Leckie and Hopkins describe a wide variety of creative projects they found people working on that “could not be characterized as merely recreational.” Patrons were using the library to inform things like theater set design, research for a film, or a photography exhibition. “Research suggests that the search for relevant information and its subsequent use in productive activity may be an integral characteristic of the construction of contemporary public culture in the emergent twenty-first century.” (Leckie, 2002)</p>
          <p>If this is true, then ludic design design fiction might have some potential for both practical and cultural purposes, because in each type of use, people are playing with new realities. We hope you’ll look at design fiction from an optimistic, but critical perspective. Could you use this? Could you use a part of this?</p></aside>
