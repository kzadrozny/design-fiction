          <p>"One is lost in a new world of a thousand possibilities...which will carry one forward into a completely unknown territory"</p>
          <small><em>Pierced Forms</em> (1959)<br/>Barbara Hepworth</small>
          <aside class="notes">Design Fiction has been used by artists for years from the small task of sketching to the final work of a performance piece. Yet, we are just beginning to catch on to what artists have been doing for decades. For example, the sculpter Barbara Hepworth used sketching and drawing as an exploratory medium; an art she felt was an "exciting adventure." She saw drawing as freeing since it didn't have the same rules as the solid materials she carved from. Hepworth would have no goal in mind but to put down lines, one after another. She decribed the act of drawing as being "lost in a new world of a thousand possibilities because the next line in association with the first will have a compulsion about it which will carry one forward into a completely unknown territory." The thing is, a sketch artist would most likely have the same feeling of freedom when it came to sculpture because it is not their chosen medium. There are no rules set for them because it is OK to break them. This is what Design Fiction does for us. It allows us to work outside of our everyday medium, present reality, and gives us the freedom to embark on an "exciting adventure" of possibilities.</aside>

          <h3>Exploring Solutions</h3>

          <small><em>Bureau for Direct Democracy</em> (1972)<br/>Joseph Beuys, Documenta 5: Kassel, Germany</small>
            <p style="font-size:0.5em; font-style:italic;"><a href="http://beforebefore.net/196c/s15/media/beuys_in_participation.pdf">Report on a Day's Proceedings at the Bureau for Direct Democracy</a>, by Dirk Schwarze</p>
          <aside class="notes">There are a multitude of ways to explore the range of possibile futures with meaningful results. In 1972 the German artist Joseph Beuys turned education and discussion into art with his 'Bureau for Direct Democracy' performance piece. For 100 days Beuys held "office hours" and discussed political, artistic, and social issues with visitors. His goal was to come to a solution that would realize "true democracy." He didn't pre-define what "true democracy" was for the participants, but allowed them to explore what that meant to them. This allowed participants and Beuys to explore all possible solutions, both negative and positive. The openness of these performance-lectures were not bound by practiced or pre-determined events, but were intended to organically prompt further discussions by the audience during and after the performance. Beuys forced passive gallery vistors to take an active role in their possible futures.</aside>

          <img class="stretch" style="border:0; box-shadow: none;" src="images/line.png"/>
          <aside class="notes">Within those 100 days, both Utopian and and Dystopian events were discussed at Beuys' performance piece. In general, people try to shy away from possible negative futures, because one always wants to depict a future as they prefer to see themselves in. But the thing is, there are very good reasons to consider the dystopian aspect when working with design fiction. While a positive future shows the strengths of your solutions, a negative outcome will help you foresee the flaws.</aside>

          <aside class="notes">Last year, Superflux Lab explored the possible failures of a "one size fits all" solution to smart objects for the elderly. The video they made shows how a smark fork, smart cane, and smart bed all fail when put against the habits of an elderly man who is set in his ways. It begins with him trying to use the smart items as intended.</aside>

It ends with him not changing any of his ways, but with is family believing that he is living a healthy lifestyle. WHile depressing, this makes you think about how to create smart items and apps that will actually mesh with a person's lifestyle while altering their behaviors.</aside>
